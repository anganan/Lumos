# Lumos
This is a teamwork project of Summer Online Course on Data Curation for Interactive
Visualisation hosted by Imperial College London in August 2022. We - Lumos - have analysed and visualised the datasets about monkeypox, where we mainly discussed the current situation, sentiment and prediction on monkeypox. There are conclusions reached according to the project:
## Current situation
- Monkeypox is closely related to travel experiences, while symptoms are mainly fever and rash. And globally, the United States is the most serious place for monkeypox, while Europe has more monkeypox patients hospitalized.
## Sentiment
- The number of the literature and tweets about monkeypox increased rapidly after the monkeypox outbreak in May this year. For literature abstracts, most emotions are neutral, while people on social media show a more pessimistic attitude.
## Prediction
- Monkeypox cases will continue to grow, but the rate of growth will gradually decline.
